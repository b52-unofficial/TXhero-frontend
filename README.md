# TX Hero Frontend


### Background and Problem Statement
When PBS (Proposer-builder Separation) settles down, builders will solidify their profit centralization using Exclusive Order Flow (EOF). The issue of builder profit centralization has evolved into a form thatâ€™s incongruent with Ethereum's core value of decentralization, concerning issues such as censorship resistance and collusion.
### Goals
* Solve the EOF problem stated above and build a more censorship-resistant network. <br>
* Transform Exclusive Order Flow into a transparent, trustless auction. <br>
* Share transaction values with the end user, who is the transaction owner. <br>

### Target Market and Audience

TX Hero targets general transactions and shares the builder's profit with transaction owners. The market can be divide into four: (1) no MEV / no profit share, (2) MEV / no profit share, (3) MEV / profit share, and (4) no MEV / profit share. (1) applies to the public mempool that exists today. (2) indicates the MEV protection methods like MEV-minimization. (3) is MEV-share by Flashbots, who share the MEV profits with users and searchers. We aim to target (4), where we protect users from harmful MEVs and share profits with the users.
